# Community Class Scraper

This app was designed to use a variety of technologies to scrape the Minneapolis Public Schools Community Education website for the latest classes. After displaying them, it allows the user to save favorite classes and add notes for later.

##Further development ideas:
- allow users to drop favorite classes from the "View Saved Classes" page
- allow users to update classes
- save/display more information about each classes such as cost, start dates, etc.
- add more styling like pictures and a more uniform color scheme
